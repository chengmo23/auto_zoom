# Auto Zoom

Auto zoom is a simple python programme which will automatically open zoom links when the lesson starts

Since I always forget to attend zoom lessons while busy at other stuffs, so I created this programme which to help me attend lessons on time.

# Features

- Open the zoom app and the meeting link at a time specified
- shows the lesson's name and meeting password (if needed) in the win 10 toast notification (this function is only for win10)
- change interval of checking whether lessons started

# Other functions to add?

- GUI with CRUD operations on lessons' details?
- auto signin ?
